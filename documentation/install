Installation instructions:

Install apache / PHP > 5.3
Clone repository into a path (ember) accessable by apache
Create a VirtualHost in apache (sample apache config in apache_config) pointing the document root to webroot in the ember dir
Update paths in sample apache config as needed

Start apache

Apache will hit any file in webroot, it defaults to index.php

Directory structure:

After you check out the code you wll need to add a few directories to the code root.

- site
- theme (optional if you want to use themes)

Sites:

if the database is not to be used for the site configuration, put a site.xml file into the config directory in system

In the sites DIR you will need to create a directory with the 'short_name' of the site you configured in the site.xml file.
In your sites directory you will need to add the following directories:
- config
- containers
- css
- js
- media
- smarty
- smarty/cache (needs to be writable by apache)
- smarty/config
- smarty/compiled (needs to be writable by apache)
- templates

the templates directory follows the same pattern as the site directory

Librarys

Smarty 3.0.7 is needed for template rendering.

Download the source from smarty.net and symlink or copy the 'lib' directory in smarty to a directory called system/lib/Smarty.
